# SupportPal Installation Templates

This repository contains templates to get started using SupportPal.

## Docker Compose

This [template](https://docs.supportpal.com/current/Deploy+on+Docker+HA) is intended for use in a microservice style architecture, whereby each service is deployed to a separate container. It provides a functional example for how you may deploy SupportPal in a HA environment.

## Docker Monolithic

This [template](https://docs.supportpal.com/current/Deploy+on+Docker) uses a monolithic image which runs all the necessary services in a single container. This is our recommended installation method.

## Linux

A [convenience script](https://docs.supportpal.com/current/Deploy+on+Linux) to install and configure system on supported Linux operating systems.
